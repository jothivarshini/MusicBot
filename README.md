# MusicBot
A music bot that I made when all the others went down 

# Idea
So there was a time when Groovy disbanded and so did it's alternatives. And I thought of this to be the starting point to create my own basic music bot since everyone else seems to be making their own. 

# Some helpful comments 
   - The bot doesn't have a token because I've removed it. You can add your own bot token in place of token.
   - Install the latest ffmpeg and also check its version to see if it's working before locally using the bot.
